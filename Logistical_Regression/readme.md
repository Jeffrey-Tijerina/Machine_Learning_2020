**Logistical Regression Algorithm**


The w is used to calculate the possibility of one point is classified to 1 or -1. In my algorithm, if the possibility is > 0.5, I consider this point classified as 1. If the possibility is < 0.5, I consider this point classified as -1. During the iterations, I record the incorrect numbers in each iteration and find the incorrect figure.
